        <p>
          Senbazuru translates to one thousand origami cranes. In Japanese culture, the act of folding a thousand cranes was believed to fulfill any wish including happiness, a healthy life, sports victories, etc. As someone who has done this process twice, while the wish part is subjective, it was very fun to fold origami cranes and satisfying to fold pieces of art, especially during times when I felt down or stressed. Initially in this world, the user would be surrounded by a thousand 3D paper cranes to convey the feelings of wonder and calmness associated with senbazuru. However, because I could not get the GLTF loader to work in the world, the one thousand boxes in the world symbolize the thousand cranes flying. On the home page, the model I animated would have replaced all one thousand boxes.
